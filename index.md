## Introduction
Many people said that "If you haven’t been up The Peak, you haven’t been to Hong Kong.". In order to provide preliminary experience for attracting visitors, the purpose of the project was to build a cyberworld of one of the most famous Hong Kong's tourist spot - "The Peak". 

A realistic 3D environment of the whole attraction was built. Worked together with another project mate, the product revealed the details of three symbols of the spot: 
- Peak Tower
- Peak Tram 
- Victoria Peak

The implemented methodologies include three aspects:
- A 3D modelling software - "Blender" was used to create the required 3D objects. 
- A 3D game development platform - "Unity" was used to integrate the 3D objects, perform movement and interactions, and build the whole world. 
- A Javascript API - "WebGL" was used to render the interactive 3D cyberworld to web browsers without usage of any plugins. 

The result of the project can bring a fruitful experience to people by three reasons: 
- Realistic attempt of Peak Tram riding
- Navigate freely around Peak Tower
- 360-degree sightseeing from different viewpoints. It is hoped that this project can help foreigners know more about The Peak.
